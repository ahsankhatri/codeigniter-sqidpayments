# Codeigniter SqidPayments Library
Simple model to generate cache of URL from database for faster performance.

Config your merchant details in `application/config/sqidpayment.php`
View sample function under `application/controllers/test.php`

I have just implemented token processing payment because of PCI Compliance issue my client don't want to follow that procedure thats why i came up with this solution. I'll add proper functionality to charge from card directly when i will get enough time for that.

Any suggestion/query will be appreciated!

Thanks.
